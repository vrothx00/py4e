# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and
# 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is
# between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
# Score Grade
# >= 0.9 A
# >= 0.8 B
# >= 0.7 C
# >= 0.6 D
# < 0.6 F
# Enter score: 0.95
# A
# Enter score: perfect
# Bad score
# Enter score: 10.0
# Bad score
# Enter score: 0.75
# C
# Enter score: 0.5
# F

score = input("Enter Score: ")
s = float(score)

if s > 1 or s < 0:
    print('You entered a value out of range')
elif s >= 0.9:
    print('A')
elif s >= 0.8:
    print('B')
elif s >= 0.7:
    print('C')
elif s >= 0.6:
    print('D')
elif s < 0.6:
    print('F')
